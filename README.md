>createSlice is a function from @reduxjs/toolkit which allows to automatically generate action creators and action types from an initial state and a reducers object. The slice name is used to generate action type constants with that name as a prefix. The keys of the reducers object will be used to generate action types that can be handled by the corresponding reducers. The initial state can be set by passing a value directly or by passing a function that returns an initial state value. Reducers can safely mutate state through the use of Immer which is integrated in @reduxjs/toolkit.
